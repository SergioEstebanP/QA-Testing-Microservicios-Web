### Tools used in the project
---

Tools used: 
- **Intellij IDEA**: is a whole Intellij IDEA project, build with gradle. An idea it's a very helpful tool for big projects.  

- **Gradle**: for build the project and make all the folders and settings to the project. Combined with intellij for download dependencies, they are so powerful. 

- **REST Assured**: libraries to testing and validate rest web services in Java. 

- **Github**: to have a control version and share knowledge with rest of the world.

- **Bitbucket**: to have a control version and share knowledge with rest of the world.

- **Postman**: tool for external testing of the service. Petstore and reqres have their own example to test their own services but if you want to test some external services which doesn't provide their own example or test services [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) solve this problem.


### Test cases implemented and tested
---

Due to the large list of services offered by [Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/) it's a good idea to have some control of which services and test cases we have already coded:

- [ ] **Pet services**:
    - [x] POST /pet: insert a new pet into the store.
    - [x] PUT /pet: update the information about an existing pet into the store.
    - [x] GET /pet/findByStatus: retrieve information from the server filtered by the status.
    - [x] GET /pet/{petId}: retrieve information from the server filtered by the id.
    - [ ] POST /pet/{petId}: updates name and status information of the given pet's id into the server.
    - [x] DELETE /pet/{petId}: deletes a pet by its id.
    - [ ] POST /pet/{petId}/uploadImage: updates name, status and image information of the given pet's id into the server.

- [x] **Store services**:
    - [x] GET /store/inventory: returns pet inventories by status.
    - [x] POST /store/order: place an order for a pet.
    - [x] GET /store/order/{orderId}: finds purchased orders by id.
    - [x] DELETE /store/order/{orderId}: delete purchased order by id.


- [x] **User services**:
    - [x] POST /user: create a user.
    - [x] POST /user/createWithArray: creates list of user with given input array.
    - [x] POST /user/createWithList: creates list of user with given input list.
    - [x] GET /user/login: log user into the system.
    - [x] GET /user/logout: logout current logged in user session.
    - [x] GET /user/{username}: get user by username.
    - [x] PUT /user/{username}: update user.
    - [x] DELETE /user/{username}: delete user.


## Project Description and example of use

### Project Configuration

---

First of all you have to clone or download the repository to your local machine. To clone it you have to enter this command:

```$ git clone https://github.com/SergioEstebanP/QA-Testing-Microservicios-Web.git```

Once you have it in your pc open Intellij IDEA and import the project:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/intellijImport.PNG)

If you want you can open the project as a folder, you only have to select the folder with the project.

Once you have the project opened you must run the project and it's possible that you have to set up some intellij IDEA configurations before run it.

### Code Explication and example

---

Now you have a running version of the program. This code is designed to automation of test programs. Here I follow a **BDD** development, which means **B**ehavior **D**riven **D**evelopment. I develop the code due to the behavior of it (program fails, program succeed ...). Some tools used for BDD are [Selenium BDD](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) to Web Browser automation. In this project I use [REST Assured](http://rest-assured.io/) to Web Services automation. Also I use [Serenity BDD](http://www.thucydides.info/#/) to see the results in a proper way, serenity provides an api to see the execution results of test cases in HTML.

#### Cucumber and Gherkin

---

The main idea of the BDD is design the scenario of use to some program and play click to test it. First of all I use [Cucumber](https://docs.cucumber.io/) to describe these scenarios of use. Cucumber allows to write in simple and natural language a scenario of use for a program. These api provide tons of languages to write the scenarios, in this case I'll use English due to the languge use in the guide!.

Cucumber use the Gherkin Syntax, knwon as **Given, When, Then**. Which means:
- *Given*: some precondition to the program.
- *When*: the program perform some actions.
- *Then*: a given result must be validated.

This is the base of BDD.

The cucumber files are saved in .feature files. One of this files, for example is: [pet.feature](src/test/resources/features/pet/pet.feature) , which looks like this:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/petFeature.PNG)

First we have to add a feature description to the test case, which is a short text explaining the actions to achieve. Then we have to create a *Scenario*, which is form by the *Given*, *And*, *Then* and *When* sentences. The And sentence could be added to any of the other in order to add some valuable information to the scenario. Also in the Scenario we declarete the parameters for the test cases because any sentences (when, and, then sentences) are linked to a java file which contains the steps to perform in the software. 

The *Scenario* limit number of parameters to one. If you want to run another test case with other parameters you have to delete the older ones and write the new ones. One solution are the *Scenarios Outline* which provide us a table with lots of parameters to perform the test case. You write a wildcard word and then the table perform one test for parameters rows in the table. 

Now we are going to see the linked java file to Cucumber steps. 


#### Example Definitions for the Steps

---

If you're using Intellij IDEA you can use <Ctrl + Right Click> in the When, And or Then sentence in cucumber file to go to the [PetExampleDefinitions.java](/src/test/java/com/adidas/gherkinDefinitions/petDefinitions/PetExampleDefinitions.java) to see the code. For example use <Ctrl + Right Click> in line 4 of pet.feature, it should go to PetExampleDefinitions.java line 54, which looks like:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/petExampleDefinitions.PNG)

Here is where we catch the parameters given by the feature and process them. For example, we check the parameter, in this case a string, and then we call to another method from other class. In theory we could do all the software test in this method but it's a good practice to avoid it due to the maintenance of the code and other factors like interconnection with other classes and methods. 

You should make this separation in order to make a properly code. You have the definitions in one class, and the 'implementation' of that definitions in other class, it's like interfaces or abstract classes, you have the interface and the implementation of that interface. If we think in architectural design it's good to have this separation because we can change de implementation without change the definition or the interface. 

Now we must go to the  [PetExampleSteps.java](/src/test/java/com/adidas/serenitySteps/petSteps/PetExampleSteps.java). As I mentioned before you can use <Ctrl + Right Click> in line 57 (PetExampleSteps).

Now we are going to go through Example Steps.

#### Example Steps 

---

If you used <Ctrl + Right Click> your IDE must be in [PetExampleSteps.java](/src/test/java/com/adidas/serenitySteps/petSteps/PetExampleSteps.java) which looks like this:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/petExampleSteps.PNG)

Here is where the magic happens. You must look at between lines 102 to 115. THe first part is the Javadoc, more important than you think, you should write it in all your codes, a minimum documentation is necessary. 

The method getPetById receives two parameters from the super class which invoke the method, if you remember, the source of this parameters are the pet.features. First we redefines the **endpoint**. The endpoint is define in the class [ServicesConfiguration.java](/src/main/java/com/adidas/config/ServicesConfiguration.java). 

The definition of the base endpoint and the other ones are:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/servicesConfiguration.PNG)

First of all, we have a template endpoint which is the base URL which provide us the services, from that endpoint we build in each request to the services the proper URL in order to do the request. For example, in this case the base URL is: *http://petstore.swagger.io/v2*, and we add the endpoint */pet* in order to execute this request, and we get the URL: *http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet*.

Now we have a proper endpoint and we can execute the request to the server. This operation it's done by the method executeRequest from class [ServicesSupport.java](/src/main/java/com/adidas/support/ServicesSupport.java). In my opinion this class, in this case it's not important, we can add this function in PetExampleSteps.java but as I said befor it's a good practice to separate the code in classes. In this class we only execute the request, it's perform by [RestAssured API](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.rest-assured/rest-assured/3.0.2). 

After perform the request we set the session variable in order to keep some results and variables of the connection, because the response will be extract from this session variable. 

Now we get at an important point, because we have done all the steps for the When sentence in the pet.feature. ¿And now what?. Now the software automatically execute the next sentence of the pet.features, in this case we do all the cycle that I describe before to the Then sentence. Once the Then sentence is done, the software go through the final And sentence to check if the result of the request is the expected one. We do this with asserts, which are sentences thath must be True, in other case the test will fail.

Now we have a complete test coded, we execute it and all it's correct. ¿We can see the results in a proper way?: Yes. Serenity BDD provide us a clear way to see the results of the test in an HTML doc.

#### Reports of Serenity BDD

---

Serenity BDD provide us a complete and automatic API to see the results in HTML file and open it in your favorite browser. If the test pass or fail isn't important now, Serenity will generate the reports anyway. This reports are located in [index.html](target/site/serenity/index.html), the path is: *target/site/serenity/index.html*. And if you open this file with a browser you should see something like this:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/serenityReport.PNG)

If we navigate in this page we see all the steps perform by our software in a proper way, with piecharts, tables, sliders ...

As mentioned before Serenity BDD it's only an API to see the results in a proper way. (We used for it I mean, because it has more features not used in this project).

With this tutorial you must understand the basis of automation test, Behaviour Driven Development and the software and API's used in real life projects. 

### Automation of Building, test, results and deploy in Jenkins

#### Setting up Docker

---

What is *Jenkins*? It's a server which provides automation tools, you can run lot of software in an automatic way. In this example we are going to automate all the process we have done manually in the steps above. 

First of all we have to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If you're using Linux you only have to run this command in the prompt:

```$ sudo apt install docker```

Docker is almost like a virtual machine, but here we have something called containers. A container is a stand alone application which runs onto a linux distribution. Containers provides more security than VM and most important facts, they are lightweight. Once we have docker installed we have to run this commands:

```$ docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts```
 
 This command download the image of a linux distribution with jenkins installed on it. Then You must power on the container. Execute this command: 
 
```$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name jk jenkins/jenkins:lts```

This command redirect the ports of the container to the local machine ports, give it a normal name (by default docker gives a random name to the container if you don't specified one). Now we have the container up. Other useful command for the future is:

```$ docker start jk ```

```$ docker exec -it -u root jk bash```

The last one allows you to enter into the bash container and execute commands as if you was in linux. Once you have all docker system ready we are going to set up jenkins server. 

If you are in Windows, you have to download the installer and execute the setup, is guided and for dummies. 

#### Setting up Jenkins

---

By default Jenkins provides the server in the http://localhost:8080 direction. You can change it but it's not important. Once you enter in this link Jenkins guide you to configure it. Select the recommended options and go ahead. You can find out more information about the set up here [Jenkins installation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).

Once you have it all ready you must see a screen like this: 

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/jenkinsMain.PNG)

First of all, I think you must set up some Jenkins configurations, like set up the gradle distribution you want to use or the JDK. You can do this in this screen: 

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/jenkinsConfiguration.PNG)

If you scroll down you would see the gradle set up and so on. There are lots of information on google to find out how to set up the plugins. The nex step is create the pipelines. 

Now you have to click in **New Job**, the you have to enter the name of the 'Project' you're going to create and select Pipeline. Then you can configure all the settings for the pipeline, now we are set up the basics. Scroll down to Pipeline and in definition you must select **Pipeline script from SCM**. Enter your favourite SMC (in my case: Git) and enter the path of the Jenkinsfile into the project. In this project you only have to write Jenkinsfile. Then apply the changes and save. Then go to the dashboard and click in the name of the pipeline you have created now. 

First of all we are going to explain the Jenkinsfile. This file contains a bunch of sentences written in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/). The [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) looks like that:

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/jenkinsFile.PNG)

This file contains a series of sentences and steps which Jenkins server will execute. In a short way, we define stages and in each stage we define the steps to be execute by Jenkins server. This steps are like linux or windows commands. We see the clone part where we obtain the source code, then we have the build part with gradle which build all the project and compile it, then we have the test part where the test features are executed in order and finally we generate the serenity reports. If we click in build now, we can see the process of all stages with the time spend in each one and the commands done. 

The result of the execution should be something like this: 

![alt intellijImport](readmeDocs/jenkinsOuput.PNG)

Jenkins server allow us to execute this pipelines by time, trigger the executions if some commit is done in the repository, etc. Jenkins server it's the perfect automation tools for QA testers.
